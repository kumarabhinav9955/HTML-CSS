-----------------HTML----------------

For best understanding use vs code 

First make a html file name it index.html

now press 
shift + ! --- then enter 

Now you will given see some code code  like this
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title> <!-- page title part-->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- here we have to write all the body part code we will let you know all the things-->

</body>
</html>

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! now some important questions !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1). What is head ?
Ans. The <head> element in HTML is a container for metadata, which is data about the document itself. This element goes between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.
2). What is body ?
Ans. it is just like prototype of the page where we write about what we want in our page.
it includes many things liks <header>,<section id="">,<nav id=""> etc.

Now let us make an project using html by making this project you will learn more about html.
